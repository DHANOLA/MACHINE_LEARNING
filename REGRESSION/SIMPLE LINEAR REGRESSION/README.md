LINEAR REGRESSION IS A LINEAR APPROACH TO MODELLING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SCALAR RESPONSE AND
ONE OR MORE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES (ALSO KNOWN AS DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLES). THE CASE OF ONE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE IS CALLED SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION.

IN LINEAR REGRESSION, THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE MODELED USING LINEAR PREDICTOR FUNCTIONS WHOSE UNKNOWN MODEL PARAMETERS ARE ESTIMATED FROM THE DATA. SUCH MODELS ARE CALLED LINEAR MODELS.

SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION IS A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WITH A SINGLE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE.THAT IS, IT CONCERNS TWO-DIMENSIONAL SAMPLE POINTS WITH ONE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND ONE DEPENDENT VARIABLE (CONVENTIONALLY, THE X AND Y COORDINATES IN A CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM) AND FINDS A LINEAR FUNCTION (A NON-VERTICAL STRAIGHT LINE) THAT, AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE, PREDICTS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE VALUES AS A FUNCTION OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE.
