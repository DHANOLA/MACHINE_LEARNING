LINEAR REGRESSION IS A LINEAR APPROACH TO MODELLING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SCALAR RESPONSE AND
ONE OR MORE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES (ALSO KNOWN AS DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT VARIABLES). THE CASE OF ONE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE IS CALLED SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION.

IN LINEAR REGRESSION, THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE MODELED USING LINEAR PREDICTOR FUNCTIONS WHOSE UNKNOWN MODEL PARAMETERS ARE ESTIMATED FROM THE DATA. SUCH MODELS ARE CALLED LINEAR MODELS.
