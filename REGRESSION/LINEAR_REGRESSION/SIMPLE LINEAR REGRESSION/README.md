##### *SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION IS A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL WITH A SINGLE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE.THAT IS, IT CONCERNS TWO-DIMENSIONAL SAMPLE POINTS WITH ONE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND ONE DEPENDENT VARIABLE (CONVENTIONALLY, THE X AND Y COORDINATES IN A CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM) AND FINDS A LINEAR FUNCTION (A NON-VERTICAL STRAIGHT LINE) THAT, AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE, PREDICTS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE VALUES AS A FUNCTION OF THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE.* #####
